# Sparkify's Data Warehouse ETL process

# Project Summary

Sparkify, a music streaming app, wants to improve their data processes on the cloud. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.


# Process

```
 Run python create_tables.py
```
The above, will create tables in Redshift


```
 Run python etl.py
```
The above will the tables by ETL process
